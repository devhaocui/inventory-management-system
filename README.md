This is a development of a inventory management system that tracks lists of items in a particular local store. 
Typically designed for store clerks or store managers to update their current existing stocks or add extra items to a new category.
The core of the codebase will be build based on C++.

TODO LIST:
1. Create a working inventory management system with C++ that stores item data locally using a .csv file.
2. Create a user registeration and login feature using basic hashing algorithm to validate each user.
3. Implement the working codebase to display all the features inside of a GUI using ImGui with GLFW + OpenGL3.
4. Modify the local storage .csv files into SQLite and integrate it into an actual database.
